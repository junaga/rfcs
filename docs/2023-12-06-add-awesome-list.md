## What's an `awesome` list

Most **GitHub orgs** - _Platforms, Programming Languages, Communities, etc_ host README.MD [`awesome` Lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome). An `awesome` List, is a reference manual of "awesome" links to **platform-based resources** - _Documentation, Libraries, Demos, Plugins, etc._, listing both official resources and 3rd party resources. The only requirement for entry is that the resource is "awesome" to platform users.

## The `luau-lang/awesome` list

Everyone in the community could document their Luau written libraries, tools, scripts, plugins, assets, etc., in `luau-lang/awesome`. One place to overview the community ecosystem.
